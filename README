OpenQuicktime version 1.00
==========================

From the OpenQuicktime site, http://www.openquicktime.org:

"OpenQuicktime aims to be a portable library for handling Apple's
QuickTime(TM) popular media files on Unix-like environments. It is
aim is to provide encoding, authoring and editing support as well
as video playback."

OpenQuicktime is currently able to decode as well as encode video
and audio streams.  The Video::OpenQuicktime library currently
only supports extracting diagnostic information from Quicktime files,
such as video dimensions, codecs used, and play length.

I would like to add support for video and audio demux at some point,
but don't have the time to develop it right now.  Given sufficient
user interest or free time, I'll do it.  Patches are also welcome
in case anyone else wants to help me out, see the contact information
below.
